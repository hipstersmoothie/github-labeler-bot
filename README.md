# GitHub Labeler Bot

## LOG

- I've crated a bot that responds to messages to get a username but i can't access their repos with my token...
- probably wont be able to do it though chat
- will need to be someone who has push access, so can't just be any collaborator
- will probably need to create an OAuth app for this
  - would still only work for people with push access
  - would need to get all collaborators and store them in a db
  - then future users could verify without push access
